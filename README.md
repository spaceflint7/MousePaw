# MousePaw

This program simulates mouse button gestures using keyboard keys.  How it works:

- Three configurable keys control the left, middle and right mouse buttons, such that pressing the key simulates pressing the corresponding mouse button.

- Then, optionally, while such a button key is held, a fourth configurable key 'locks' the button, so it remains held even after releasing the keys.

- Alternatively, three other configurable keys simulate pressing a mouse button and keeping it held, without having to hold any button keys at all.

Any of those seven configurable keys can be left unset, if some of the functionality is not needed.

Three sets of key may be configured, and selected from the notification icon in the Windows taskbar tray.

Portable, single EXE file; configuration settings are saved in a text file in the same folder.

### Download and run [MousePaw.exe](https://github.com/spaceflint7/MousePaw/raw/master/MousePaw.exe)

This program borrows its program icon from, and was generally inspired by, [MouseKeys++](https://github.com/DarthBrento/MouseKeysPlusPlus), which can also simulate mouse movement.
